This project is a trojan horse application, passing itself as a reverse-engineering assignment. The main goal of the malware is to switch out the victim's pictures with a picture of the attacker's choosing. However, there are many "punishments", with varying degrees of severity.

Upon starting the application you will get a series of reverse-engineering challenges, with climbing difficulty. If you fail a challenge, you will be subjected to a variety of "punishments". Some of these are harmless pranks, while others will crash the machine.

**DO NOT RUN THIS APPLICATION ON A MACHINE YOU CARE ABOUT**

To run for the first time you need to run the vc_redist.x64 application, which installs some needed visual C runtime libraries, and then run untitled.exe. If you want to run it again you just need to run untitled.exe.
